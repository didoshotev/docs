# üêõ Bug Bounty

Yield Yak has set aside a Bug Bounty budget of **100 YAK** for responsible disclosure of bugs.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a problem or vulnerability with any Yield Yak contract, please share the information with a developer (as soon as possible). [Telegram](https://t.me/yieldyak) provides direct access to developers. Users tagged with "Yak Guide" can also provide access to developers. Alternatively, use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yieldyak\_).

Bug bounties will be awarded for being the first to report a severe security issue (e.g. one which results in the change of code or configuration), with a reasonable amount of time given for resolving the issue.

The exact amount of a bug bounty will vary, based on different factors, including whether or not user funds are at risk and a subjective measure of the risk. While we introduce a budget, there is no guarantee that the budget will be fully distributed or realized by any individual report or reporter.
