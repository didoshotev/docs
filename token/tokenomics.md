# Tokenomics

## Total Supply

10,000 YAK \(est. wild yaks roaming on Earth\)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fixed Supply**

YAK is a fixed-supply token. No additional YAK may be minted now or in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Circulating Supply

The vast majority of the YAK token supply entered circulation following the initial distribution. On the first day,

* Circulating: 7,350 YAK
* Non-circulating: 2,650 YAK
  * Team: 1,500 YAK
  * Ecosystem: 1,150 YAK

Tokens will move from non-circulating to circulating based on team tokens vesting and ecosystem tokens being used for community initiatives.

## Initial Distribution

Early users took considerable risk using a new platform. Their feedback influenced the product. Their deposits grew the platform. Therefore the initial distribution of YAK tokens is heavily weighted toward early users:

* 50% Depositors \(airdrop\)
* 15% Reinvest pushers \(airdrop\)
* 15% Team \(vested\)
* 15% Ecosystem
* 5% Community \(airdrop\)

### Airdrop Recipients

The full list of airdrop recipients is available [here](https://github.com/yieldyak/airdrop).

### Unclaimed Airdrop Tokens

Airdrop recipients were provided a 30-day window to claim tokens. Following the deadline, the remaining tokens were returned to the treasury.
