The $YAK token has not been deployed. Do not get scammed.

## Total Supply

10,000 $YAK \(est. wild yaks roaming on Earth\)

## Distribution

Early users took considerable risk using a new platform. Their feedback formed the product. Therefore the initial distribution of $YAK tokens is heavily weighted toward early users:

* 50% Depositors \(snapshot pending\)
* 15% Reinvest pushers \(snapshot taken\)
* 15% Team
* 15% Partners
* 5% Community \(snapshot taken\)

## Utility

* **On-chain Governance.** Staked $YAK will control the network, including parameters for fees and other important configurations.
* **Native Revenue.** Staked $YAK will receive $AVAX. Network revenue \(collected in tokens, usually\) will be converted to AVAX and distributed to stakers.
* **Sustainable Incentives.** Any incentive models that distribute $YAK will be accomplished by using network revenue instead of inflating supply.
